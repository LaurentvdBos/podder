The best container runtime you can find!

- Minimizes disk wear by storing the last layer of the container in memory.
- Implemented in Python, which makes it very easy for developers to pick it up.
- Reuses linux kernel calls, which is also a great learning opportunity for developers to get more used to linux!
- Work in progress: works both on x86_64 and ARM64!
